/**
* @file Module.h
* Definition of the module handling schema.
* @author <a href="mailto:Thomas.Roefer@dfki.de">Thomas RÃ¶fer</a>
*
* This file provides the ability to specify the requirements of and the
* representations provided by a module. Example:
*
* MODULE(MyImageProcessor)
*   REQUIRES(Image)                                      // Has to be updated before
*   REQUIRES(CameraMatrix)                               // Has to be updated before
*   USES(RobotPose)                                      // Is used, but has not to be updated before
*   PROVIDES_WITH_MODIFY(BallPercept)                    // Class provides a method to update BallPercept. Representation can be MODIFYed.
*   PROVIDES_WITH_OUTPUT(BeaconsPercept)                 // Class provides a method to update BeaconsPercept. Representation can be requested.
*   PROVIDES_WITH_MODIFY_AND_OUTPUT(LinesPercept)        // Class provides a method to update LinesPercept. Representation can be MODIFYed and requested to be sent with given message.
*   PROVIDES(GoalsPercept)                               // Class provides a method to update GoalsPercept.
*   DEFINES_PARAMETER(float, focalLen, 42.0f)            // Has a parameter named focalLen of type float. By default it has the value 42.0f.
*   LOADS_PARAMETER(int, resHeight)                      // Has a parameter named resHeight of type int. It should be initialized from a configuration file.
*   DEFINES_PARAMETER(int, resWidth, 21)                 // All attributes are streamed and can be accsessed by requesting 'parameters:MyImageProcessor'
*   DEFINES_PARAMETER(CameraInfo, Camera, camera, lower) // Use an enum as parameter that was defined in a certain class.
* END_MODULE
*
* This block defines a base class MyImageProcessorBase. The module MyImageProcessor has to be
* derived from that class:
*
* class MyImageProcessor : public MyImageProcessorBase
* {
*   void update(BallPercept& ballPercept);
*   void update(BeaconsPercept& beaconsPercept);
*   void update(GoalsPercept& goalsPercept);
* };
*
* In the implementation file, the existence of the module has to be announced:
*
* MAKE_MODULE(MyImageProcessor)
