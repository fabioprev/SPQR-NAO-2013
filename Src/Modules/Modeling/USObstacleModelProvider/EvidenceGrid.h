/**
* @file EvidenceGrid.h
* The file declares a class that represents a grid of evidences for the presence of obstacles.
* Each cell contains a measurement history representing the previous up to 16 measurements.
* It also contains a counter that represents how many of these measurements considered the
* cell as occupied.
* The grid is centered as good as possible around the robot, i.e. it shifts so that its center
* is only up to half of a cell width away from the position of the robot. The grid is never
* rotated.
