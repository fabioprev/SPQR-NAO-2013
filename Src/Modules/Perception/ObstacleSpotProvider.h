/**
 * The ObstacleSpotProvider takes PossibleObstacleSpots and refines them into
 * clustered spots at the feet of obstacles.
 *
 * It consists of a small pipeline that refines the spots in several steps:
 * 1. Check how much not-green is above and below a possible obstacle spot.
 *    This determines the upper and lower boundary of the obstacle. If the obstacle is noth
 *    high enough it is discarded.
 *    If we are looking at an image from the lower camera and the obstacle is
 *    touching the upper border of the image the obstacle is buffered and evaluated
 *    when the next upper image comes around.
 *    This steps include several hacks to avoid certain types of false positives
 *    which are not part of this documentation :)
 *    The lower border of every obstacle is saved. All further steps operate
 *
 * 2. Spots are sorted from bottom to top. This is important for the following steps.
 *
 * 3. Obstacle spots at the hands/arms of robots are removed. This is done by
 *    assuming that the bottom most spot inside any image is at the foot of a robot.
 *    Based on the bottom most spot ban zones are calculated that should contain the arms/hands
 *    of the robot. All spots inside those ban zones are removed. This step
 *    is repeated until no spots are removed.
 *
 * 4. Spots are clustered and a center of mass is calculated for each cluster.
 *
 * 5. A rectangle around the robot is calculated for each cluster based on it's
 *    center of mass. This rectangle is also called a ban zone (sorry for that :) )
 *
 * 6. If the center of mass of one cluster is inside the ban zone of another cluster
 *    it is removed. This is done in a way that clusters that are closer to the robot
 *    remain while the ones further away are removed.
 *
 * @note This comment is a very brief overview. It is by no means complete.
 *       There are lots and lots and lots of small bugfixes, workarounds and hacks
 *       woven into this code :)
